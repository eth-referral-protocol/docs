title: Creating Programs
---

In this guide, you will create a new referral program, and be returned its unique program ID.

## Calling newReferralProgram

```solidity
function newReferralProgram(
    address to,
    address[] memory hooks
) external returns (
    uint256 programId
)
```

Calling the ```newReferralProgram``` function on the [ERP smart contract](/docs/deployed-contracts) will return a program ID. This unique ID is what will be used to reference your referral program in the future.

This function also takes a parameter called hooks, this is an array of addresses that must inherit the [IERPHooks](/docs/interfaces/ierp-hook) interface, and will be called before, and after all new referrals, and is how you will build your custom referral logic.
