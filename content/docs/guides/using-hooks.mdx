title: Using Hooks
---

Referral programs are made up of hooks, which are smart contracts that get called every time the referral program is interacted with.

## Inheriting the hook interface

```solidity
interface IERPHook {
    function beforeReferral(
        uint256 programId,
        address account,
        address referral
    ) external;
    
    function afterReferral(
        uint256 programId,
        address account,
        address referral
    ) external;
}
```

In order to make your hook smart contracts compatible with ERP, they must inherit the [IERPHook](/docs/deployed-contracts) interface.

## Hook functions

The hook interface has two functions, ```beforeReferral``` and ```afterReferral```. These functions are called before and after a referral respectively. You can override these functions to develop your own custom logic which is run atomically on new referrals.
